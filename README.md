# AlleGit

This is my solution to task no.1 from Allegro assessment test. To build the app I used SwiftUI, which allowed me to quickly sketch out the preliminary design of my application, and display all the important information right from the get go, i.e. name of the repository, short description, what programming language was used to build a given application (if there was any), and number of stars. The cards that display this information are all buttons that, once tapped, move to a detail screen, where the user can access more information by tapping on the button that opens the whole repository in Safari. Once I built the app, I performed a simple refactor into an MVVM model that is a common pattern when designing apps using the SwiftUI framework.
